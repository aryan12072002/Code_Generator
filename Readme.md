# 🔥 AI-Powered Code Generator (Flask + Deep Learning)

This project is a **Flask-based Code Generator** that uses **Deep Learning (DL) & Machine Learning (ML)** to generate code from natural language prompts.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Accepts text prompts and generates code using AI models.
- ✅ Supports multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
- ✅ Simple and user-friendly web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- ✅ Backend powered by **Flask** and **Hugging Face Transformers**.
- ✅ Cross-Origin support (CORS enabled) for easy integration.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/code-generator.git
cd code-generator
```
2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```bash
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Run Flask App
python app.py
5️⃣ Open in Browser
Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

🎯 Usage
Enter a prompt (e.g., "Write a Python function to add two numbers.").
Click "Generate Code".
The AI will generate and display the relevant code.
🔧 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/generate	Generate code from a prompt
Example Request:

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
Backend: Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
ML Model: Code-Generation Model (e.g., bigcode/starcoder)
🛠️ Troubleshooting
Common Issues & Fixes
❌ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'
✅ Run: pip install flask

❌ CORS error in browser console
✅ Ensure flask-cors is installed and added to app.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)

📜 License
MIT License © 2025 Your NamePS traffic between users and web applications.
Protects against SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), etc.
Example: Cloudflare WAF, AWS WAF, ModSecurity.
Internal Network Segmentation Firewall
Divides the network into segments (e.g., database servers, application servers, frontend).
Prevents lateral movement in case of an intrusion.
Example: Using VLANs and firewall rules to limit internal access.
Host-based Firewall
Installed on individual servers to allow only necessary services.
Example: iptables, UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), Windows Defender Firewall.
Cloud Security Groups & Firewalls
If using cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), security groups and firewall rules help limit access.
Example: AWS Security Groups, Network ACLs.
Example Production Firewall Rules
bash
CopyEdit
# Allow only necessary services (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH)
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Deny all other incoming traffic
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw enable


2. Firewall in Deployment Level
A deployment environment is used for testing and staging before moving to production. The security needs here are slightly relaxed but should still protect the system from unauthorized access.
Key Firewall Considerations for Deployment
Restricted External Access
Allow only trusted IPs (developers, testers) to access the system.
Example: Whitelist office VPN IPs for SSH and database access.
Temporary Open Ports
Some deployment processes may require opening temporary ports for configuration.
Example: Allowing port 8080 for an internal Jenkins server but blocking it in production.
Monitoring & Logging
Enable logging to track firewall rule violations during testing.
Example: AWS CloudTrail, Fail2Ban for SSH monitoring.
Simulating Attacks (Penetration Testing)
Conduct firewall penetration tests before deploying to production.
Example: Using nmap to check for open ports.
bash
CopyEdit
nmap -p 1-65535 <server-ip>



Comparison of Firewalls in Production vs Deployment
Feature
Production Firewall
Deployment Firewall
Access Control
Strict, only necessary traffic
Less strict, for testing
Internal Segmentation
Strong segmentation (VLANs, private networks)
Limited segmentation
Logging & Monitoring
Continuous monitoring, alerts enabled
Logs enabled, but relaxed alerts
Testing & Security
Enforced security policies
Security testing allowed
Open Ports
Minimal open ports
Some additional ports for testing
